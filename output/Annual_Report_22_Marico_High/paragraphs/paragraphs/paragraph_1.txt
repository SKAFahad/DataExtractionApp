LEADERSHIP MESSAGES
Dear Valued Shareholders,  
I am pleased to share my thoughts and present the 
Annual Report for the financial year 2022-23.
As I write this letter to you, I want to take this opportunity 
to express my sincerest gratitude to all our valued 
shareholders for your continued confidence in Marico 
as we delivered another year of robust performance 
across key business parameters. The show of resilience 
and strength, amidst a volatile and challenging business 
environment during the year, has once again reinforced 
our belief in the lasting strength of your Company's 
strategic building blocks of brands, people and culture.  
Despite macroeconomic headwinds affecting consumption 
sentiment, your Company continued its healthy growth 
trajectory with a revenue growth of 8.47% and a net profit 
growth of 8.96%, and closed the year with profit after tax of 
BDT 387.2 Crore. In FY23, we declared a healthy dividend 
of 750% and contributed BDT 456 crores to the national 
exchequer.
Your company continues to operate through its heritage 
brands of Parachute, Parachute Advansed, Nihar 
and Saffola recognized by Bangladesh Brand Forum. 
‘Parachute Advansed’ remains the ‘Most Loved Hair 
Oil brand’ in the country and is amongst the ten most 
loved brands in Bangladesh. Recognitions like these are 
testament to the enduring loyalty and confidence of our 
consumers in the quality of our products and our ability 
to connect with consumers across categories. 
Our underlying strategy of strengthening our core 
businesses and expanding our new product portfolio has 
pivoted us towards a predictable and consistent growth 
journey. During the year, your Company continued its 
effort to diversify its product portfolio with new product 
launches in the hair care and skin care segments. 
The commissioning of our 3rd manufacturing unit, 
located in Bangabandhu Shilpanagar within the Mirasarai 
Economic Zone, is making steady progress and will be 
ready to commence production this year. We aspire to be 
proud ambassadors of ‘Made in Bangladesh’ initiative, as 
we deliver high quality products that meet the needs of 
our consumers and provide a delightful user experience.
We believe consistent focus towards strengthening the 
talent and culture of Marico will make us a future-ready 
organization. Our leadership is fully committed towards 
fostering indigenous talent while upholding the principles 
of inclusion and diversity. We believe a diverse talent pool 
not only brings in a wider range of skills and expertise, but 
also acts as a strategic advantage in the current business 
environment. We are proud that 99% of our workforce 
comprises local talent with millennials constituting 80% 
of our workforce. At Marico Bangladesh, we believe we 
have top-tier talent capable of accomplishing exceptional 
results and thriving in a dynamic environment. Nielsen's 
Campus Track survey recognizes us as one of the Top 10 
Employers of Choice in the country and third in the FMCG 
Sector.
As a responsible corporate citizen, Marico has long 
emphasised on ethically and environmentally sustainable 
operations and business practices which create long-
term value for all stakeholders. We implemented 31 
sustainability projects during FY 22-23 in our factories, 
leading to lower power consumption and reduction in 
carbon emissions from our factories. 
We continued our impactful social responsibility program 
with SWAPNO and were recognized by The Daily Star “A 
Better Tomorrow” CSR Awards for our partnership in the 
SWAPNO program and its impact on social and financial 
inclusion of financially disadvantaged women. 
As we move into the next year, we continue to believe 
in the strong growth prospects and resilience of the 
Bangladesh economy. Global institutions have also 
projected an improving outlook for the economy, aided 
by lower energy costs and recovery in exports. We will 
continue to invest in long-term business capabilities of 
leadership, digital, innovation and brand building, while 
maintaining our focus on optimizing costs and execution. 
I would like to conclude by expressing my sincere gratitude 
to Marico's esteemed shareholders, regulators, industry 
peers, CSR partners, and consumers for their unwavering 
support. With our shared vision and relentless pursuit of 
success, we will continue our efforts towards forging a 
path towards sustainable growth. We believe that, with 
strong underlying business fundamentals at play, we 
will continue to deliver healthy business growth while 
creating long-term value for each of our stakeholders.
With warm regards,

macro-economic environment and grown in revenues, 
portfolios, talent, and furthered principles of inclusion & 
diversity, social responsibility initiatives. 
Throughout the year we continued to invest in new 
product launches and extensions of the hair care and 
skin care categories. I am pleased to announce that we 
have achieved robust financial results in FY22-23. Our 
total revenue increased by 8.47% and profits by 8.96% 
compared to the previous year. This remarkable growth 
can be attributed to our strategic focus on expanding our 
core portfolio, distribution, operational efficiencies and 
capitalizing on emerging opportunities. Construction of our 
3rd manufacturing unit in the Bangabandhu Shilpanagar 
in Mirasarai Economic Zone has made steady progress 
and is expected to commence operations this year.

the key strategic pillars underlying our business growth. 
The company continued portfolio diversification during 
the year and extended our offerings in the Hair Care

strengthened the value mix in our business.

Managing Key Material Matters 
Material matters are those that substantively affect our ability to create value over time.
Stakeholders provide Marico with critical resources that enable the Company to generate competitive sustainable value 
over the short, medium and long term. Engaging with our stakeholders allows us to understand their viewpoints and 
expectations. The feedback thus generated helps us to develop effective strategies for sustainable long-term value 
creation through the refinement of our products and services and our go-to-market strategies. 
We review our material matters during our annual planning cycle, our strategic reviews and monthly work-plans. The 
management team makes an initial assessment – drawing on their experience, judgement, and their own engagement 
with stakeholders – and agree which matters may be material and the response measures to address the materiality.  
Identification of Key Material Matters

Message from our CFO
Marico continues to enjoy a position of strength in Bangladesh, expanding its portfolio and producing world-class 
products that have become household brands. With this foundation, our Company has enjoyed continued growth in 
sales based on our inherent strengths, such as the depth of our management expertise and knowledge, our unrivalled 
brand strength, and an enviable distribution system. 
Financial year 2022-23 witnessed another black swan event leading to inflation and adverse movement of exchange 
rate, We focused on adapting in a highly challenging external macro environment. Our key financial objective for the 
year was to sustain growth to support our expansion plans, construction of our 3rd manufacturing unit at Bangabandhu 
Shilpanagar while also investing in capability development. 
Amidst a challenging environment, we delivered value growth even as we launched new products which strengthened 
our presence in relevant categories. Board has announced cash dividend of 750%, for 2022-23.
We thank you for your investment in Marico.

Our Manufacturing Highlights  
Capacity Enhancement and Efficiency 
One of the main highlights of 2023 is successful completion of the production capacity increase of our crushing unit 
at Shirirchala Factory from 120 TPD to 240 TPD, marking a significant milestone in our journey towards growth and 
operational excellence. The augmented production capacity would allow us to meet growing demand of our brands. 
Additionally, spent earth storage capacity has been doubled.
OUR MANUFACTURED CAPITAL 
To improve operational efficiency and meet growing market demands, our factory in Mouchak also invested in capacity 
enhancement measures. Automation in the sleeving operation for Parachute Advansed Aloe Vera and Parachute 
Advansed Extra Care proved to be a significant advancement, increasing the sleeving operation BPM to 80 from 25. 
This eliminated need for third-party dependency for Parachute Advansed Extra Care Sleeving, ensuring 100% in-house 
operation. Additionally, the automation project reduced yearly power consumption by 46%.

Wastages reduction
Manufacturing team’s commitment to the bottom line of 
the business has been evident through various initiatives 
to control wastages at different stages of the processes. 
The increased production capacity of Shirirchala factory 
was accompanied by improvements in extraction 
efficiency and refinery yield, reaching 96.6% and 91.4%, 
respectively. These enhancements contributed to cost 
savings and increased output volume. The adoption of 
power saving technologies reduced electrical noise and 
harmonics, resulting in power savings of 1% in FY'23 at

A plastic palletizer machine facilitated the reuse of 5,712 
KGS of plastic waste. Other advancements include the 
Contherm heat exchanger and the EBM racking system, 
which increased storage capacity by 1.8 times. The 
implementation of a new racking system has enhanced 
our blown bottle storage capabilities, allowing us to 
accommodate a substantially larger number of bottles 
efficiently and effectively. By utilizing the vertical space, 
our racking system has freed up valuable floor area 
and optimization of this space contributes to a more 
streamlined and productive working environment along 
with ensuring better accessibility in more organized 
manner. We have increased our storage capacity to 1.75 
times of our previous capacity. 
Mouchak plant also enhanced its in-house storage 
capacity by installing a racking system, creating a total 
storage capacity of 13,780 sq ft. This improvement allowed 
for maximum utilization of vertical space, ensuring Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage.

engagement forum ‘Marico Family Day’. This year’s theme ‘Colours of Marico’ was an ode to the very vibrant Marico 
family! The day was spent outdoors, filled with fun and exciting activities for all, ranging from kid’s biscuit race, cricket

during purchase decision time. To encourage 
their distributors and retailers to sell more 
of their products, Marico Bangladesh runs 
trade plans that offer them incentives like 
cash rewards & volume-based discounts. A 
variety of consumer promotions, including

DIRECTORS' REPORT
A message to our Shareholders
The Board of Directors (‘the Board’) of Marico Bangladesh Limited is proud to present to you the 13th Annual Report of 
the Company after being listed on the Dhaka & Chittagong stock exchanges. 
Principal Business Activities of Company
Manufacturing and marketing of fast-moving consumer 
goods (‘FMCG’) continued to remain the core business 
activities of Marico Bangladesh Limited. The Company 
is the manufacturer and marketer of renowned brands 
such as Parachute, Parachute Advansed, Just For Baby, 
Nihar, Parachute SkinPure, Parachute Naturale, Mediker 
SafeLife, Saffola Active, Studio X , HairCode and Livon. The 
Company had a vibrant year of portfolio diversification 
with multiple new product launches and extensions in hair 
oil and skin care categories. Marico’s portfolio of winning

Industry Outlook and Possible Future 
Developments in the Industry
The scope of ‘Fast Moving Consumer Goods’ (FMCG) 
industry has expanded over the years and include 
products which are daily essentials as well as those which 
are aspirational and typically sold/traded rapidly in the 
market. Bangladesh’s GDP is expected to grow by 6% in the 
year 2023 according to the latest forecast from eminent 
International Financial Institutions. However, country’s 
inflation is expected to be in the range of 8% to 9% in FY23 
which is likely to put pressure on private consumption. 
Further the exchange rate could continue to see adverse 
movement. Overall, the economic outlook of 2023 remains 
cautious leading to conservative growth projections in the 
FMCG industry.
According to the World Bank, Bangladesh's economic 
growth projection is likely to be 5.2 percent for the 2023-
24 fiscal year considering the multiplier effects of the war 
in Ukraine. Global forecasts predict that FMCG market 
will grow at a CAGR of 3.2% and emerging markets will 
continue to grow ahead of developed markets. Increase 
in per capita income, introduction of new distribution and 
retail channels and the millennial population will dictate 
consumer preferences and shifts in product offerings

Segment-Wise Performance	
During the year ended 31 March 2023, the company 
continued its drive for portfolio diversification with new 
launches in hair care and skin care categories. The 
Company strengthened it’s presence in the skin care 
category this year with the launch of Glo On Pink Glow 
Cream. The new introductions are an indication of our 
consumer-centricity and efforts to play in the markets 
with a right to win for Marico. Given the human capital 
and intellectual capital of the Company, it is also foraying 
into traditionally red-ocean markets as well with an 
aspiration to grow and succeed. In FY 23 the Company’s 
household penetration stood at approximately 89.7%. 
Marico posted BDT 1,413.6 Cr total revenue for the year 
ended 31 March 2023 with 8.47% growth compared to 
last year. The growth was driven by PCNO, VAHO, Beauty 
& Health and Baby Care segments. Over the years the 
Company has made a significant shift in the volume 
and value mix of its portfolio to lower dependence on 
the branded coconut oil segment. Contribution of other 
segments in volume & value mix increased as strong 
initiatives have been taken to strengthen the non-coconut 
oil market share as well as maintaining the leadership 
in the coconut oil category.  The segment performance 
is set out in Note 18 in the financial statements and 
represented below: 
Risks and Concerns
The Board regularly monitors, assesses and identifies 
potential risks, threats to sustainability and profitability 
and negative impact on environment. The Company 
adheres to an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework which the Board reviews at regular intervals 
and also assesses litigation, regulatory and fraud risks. 
Details of Risks and concerns including internal and 
external risk factors are discussed in the ‘Enterprise Risk 
Management’ section on page 121 in this Annual Report. 
Special Note on Risks and Concerns 
The global economic situation has become fragile due 
to prolonged war in Ukraine and the global supply chain 
continues to remain under stress. There is significant 
depreciation of BDT against US Dollar and settlement 
of material bills remain a challenge. The Company 
is continually monitoring this uncertain scenario and 
taking measures under the ERM framework to cushion 
against macro-economic shocks including working 
closely with our banking partners, raw material inventory 
management and optimizing freight costs. The agile 
implementation of contingency plans ensured minimal 
impact on business operations in FY23. The Board and 
management are cautiously optimistic for the FY 24 
outlook given the macroeconomic environment and 
are of the view that the risk mitigation plans will ensure 
continuation or sustainability of the business.
Discussion on Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit 
Margin and Net Profit Margin
Cost of Sales: 
Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2023 increased by 
8.47% and due to increase of raw material price in global 
market and adverse movement of exchange rate, cost of 
sales increased by 14.27% compared to last year. 
Gross Profit: 
Gross profit for the year ended 31 March 2023 in absolute 
terms has grown by 3.58%. Efficient management of 
costs along with improved brand mix contributed to the 
profit growth.

Net profit for the year ended 31 March 2023 was BDT 
387.2 Cr. It increased by 8.96% compared to last year in 
absolute term. Higher revenue growth and efficient cost

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FY’23 was yet another year of unprecedented challenges on one hand and company’s perseverance on the other. 
The Company delivered benchmark growth in value amidst the dual challenge of high inflation and significantly 
adverse movement of the exchange rate. During these tumultuous times the Company grew profits, invested in 
future capacity, and ensured dividend payments. This performance was driven by growth in core categories, launch 
of new products, augmenting distribution, and accelerated capability development. 
At a full year Level, Marico Bangladesh Ltd. has registered an 8.47% revenue growth and maintained its leadership 
in the coconut oil (CNO) category and in the value-added hair oils (VAHO) category which grew by 6.7% at a full 
year level. Revenue growth was driven by Parachute Advanced, Beliphool, Parachute Naturale, Just for Baby and 
has been further boosted by new launches — Parachute Advanced Onion, Glo- On and Hair Code color shampoo.
The revenue mix continues to evolve as the non-coconut 
oil revenue contribution has increased steadily with the 
portfolio diversification. This is attributable to steady 
expansion of our personal care/beauty & health range 
and baby care segment.
Gross Margin
In FY’23, gross margins came under pressure. Marico 
Bangladesh Limited has reported gross profit margin of 
51.82% which is 2.45% lower than LY. However gross profit 
in absolute terms has grown by 3.58% compared to LY 
primarily on account of favorable topline impact.
Marketing, Selling & Distribution exp
In FY23, Marketing, Selling & distribution expense as a 
percentage of revenue decreased by 2.62% (7% in FY23 vs 
9.62% in FY22) compared to LY- which in absolute terms 
translated to a decrease of 21%. During the year spends 
were rationalized to hedge margins against external 
shocks and investments were focused on new launches 
and brand-building in the non-coconut oil portfolio of the 
business. 
General & Administration Exp
Expense as percentage to topline stood at 8.6% which is a 
slight reduction from last year. However, in FY’23, general 
and admin expenditure increased by 2.6% in absolute 
terms primarily in employment cost due to inflationary 
adjustment. 
Profit after Tax
Profit for the year grew by 8.96% compared to LY in 
absolute terms driven by growth in revenues and 
efficient management of different types of expenses. 
MBL reported a net margin of 27.4% in FY23 compared 
to 27.3% in LY.

Industry Scenario 
The peer companies within the FMCG industry includes 
Unilever Bangladesh, SQUARE Toiletries Limited, Hemas 
Bangladesh, Moushumi Industries, Dabur Bangladesh, 
Emami Bangladesh, Reckitt Benckiser among others. 
However only Reckitt Benckiser Bangladesh Limited (RB) 
is listed with the stock exchanges among peer companies 
to enable an industry benchmarking. RB reported a 
growth of 0.55% in turnover and a profit degrowth 
of 18.42% as disclosed in their latest annual financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.  
e.	
Financial and economic scenario of the country 
and the globe
Global 
financial 
and 
multilateral 
institutions 
are 
forecasting another year of uncertainty and recessionary 
environment for global economy owing to the war in 
Ukraine. Commodities prices and financial markets all 
over the world have witnessed significant volatility since 
the war erupted. The war has magnified the slowdown in 
the global economy with a protracted period of feeble 
growth and elevated inflation, according to the World 
Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects report. Global 
GDP growth in 2023 is projected to be 2.7%, the lowest 
annual growth rate since the global financial crisis, except 
for the 2020 pandemic period. A modest improvement to 
2.9% is foreseen for 2024. The war in Ukraine and the risk 
of stagflation are hammering growth. The World Bank 
and global financial institutions predict that for many 
countries, recession will be hard to avoid. 
This grim global economic outlook is likely to impact 
Bangladesh in varied measure. The war in Ukraine has led 
to a fall in the supply of dollars, while demand remained 
high leading to falling currency value of Bangladeshi 
Taka. Growth therefore continues to face headwinds. 
With the completion of large-scale infrastructure projects 
like the Padma Bridge and Metrorail, Bangladesh is 
urging OECD nations to grant preferential treatment 
and has secured an agreement with IMF. Bangladesh's 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is anticipated to grow 
by 6% in fiscal year (FY) 2023, according to the most 
recent Asian Development Bank (ADB) study, Asian 
Development Outlook (ADO) April 2023. Additionally, 
because of energy restrictions and rising costs of imports 
the growth of private investments could be slower. As a 
result of decreasing tax revenue, austerity measures, and 
declining foreign exchange reserves, public investment 
growth is likely to be weaker. Inflation is anticipated to 
increase from 6.2% in FY2022 to 8% to 9% in FY2023.
f.	
Risks and concerns 
The financial statements have been prepared for the year 
ended 31 March 2023. Financial risks are addressed with 
secured contracts and buyer financing arrangements 
as well as foreign exchange hedging policies. Given 
the devaluation of Bangladeshi currency and ensuing 
inflation, the Company is putting in additional measures 
in place in terms of sourcing, inventory management, 
cash-flow management to protect business performance 
against the macro-economic shocks. Having strong 
internal control systems, management has ensured 
good governance and footprint of Marico Business 
in Bangladesh. The Company has a formalized risk 
management framework and process under the 
governance and supervision of the Audit Committee.
We perceive that proactive management of these risks 
is of fundamental significance to ensure our business 
growth. We regularly identify functional and entity level 
risks and do extensive reviews to ensure the risks are 
righty identified and proper mitigation plans are in place 
for the same. The entity level risks for the business have 
been discussed in detail under section of “Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework” at page 121 of this report.

STATUTORY REPORTS
Future Outlook
The GDP growth rate of Bangladesh is forecasted to be 
6% in the Financial Year (FY) 2023, says the World Bank in 
its latest Global Economic Prospects report for January 
2023. It cites rising inflation and its negative impact on 
household incomes and firms’ input costs, as well as 
energy shortages, import restrictions, and monetary 
policy. However, the growth rate is forecast to rise to 6.2% 
in FY 2024.
We have reviewed our annual operating plans to account 
for the macro-economic environment and are also 
reviewing our strategy from quarter to quarter to adjust 
to changes as they materialize. Marico commenced 
construction of its 3rd and largest manufacturing unit 
in Bangabandhu Shilpanagar in the Mirsarai special 
economic zone (MEZ) and will be ready for  commencing  
production in Quarter2 of FY24. The unit will cater to the 
growth aspirations of Company’s hair oil portfolio as 
well as inventory for raw and packaging material. The 
enhanced capacity and strategic location will enable 
Marico to better serve its consumers all over Bangladesh.
While liquidity is not a challenge for the business, efficient 
management of overheads and production costs is going 
to be a priority for the next year particularly considering 
the macroeconomic adversities. In terms of portfolio 
the Company is committed to building its new brands 
and strengthening category foothold of new launches. 
The Company has a rigorous focus on its go-to-market 
strategy to ensure execution excellence in servicing the 
market with a range of portfolios. Leveraging real time 
data and analytics and increased automation will be key 
drivers in unlocking efficiencies in the entire supply chain. 
While consumer preferences evolve and consumption 
may fluctuate due to inflationary pressures, reinforcing 
trust from consumers in core categories and maintain a 
balanced portfolio of consumer essentials will continue 
to remain critical strategic pillars of the business. Social 
media and e commerce penetration continues to grow 
in Bangladesh, Marico will continue to invest more in 
digital marketing and innovative ways of consumer 
connect through social media. As a channel, ecommerce 
and cosmetics will gain increased relevance especially 
considering the newer portfolios of the business. 
Retaining trust and relevance in core categories and 
portfolio expansion into the identified categories of the 
future remains one of the key pillars of Marico’s long-term 
strategy. At the same time, with our distribution strength, 
we will endeavor to ensure continuous availability of 
stock across channels and flexibility in our supply chain. 
Last but not least we are committed to growing and 
developing talent, across levels through impactful 
learning and development interventions. Employee 
welfare, health, safety and an energizing, safe culture are 
also critical pillars to achieve our vision of doubling our 
business by 2025. 
We believe we will be able to stay on a growth path, 
despite 
multiple 
challenges 
of 
macro-economic 
environment, by exhibiting higher degree of agility and 
will continue to expand the consumer franchise.

Operations 
Risk 
These relate to risks that can destabilize the production and supply of products to the market. MBL has 
two factories in the Gazipur area which is prone to labour unrest due to surrounding garments industries. 
In order to protect against this risk the management ensures a rigorous program of engagement, 
dialogue and capability building of all factory personnel. There is a process of monitoring and recording 
factory compliance & pro-active dialogue with regulators to safeguard against compliance lapses that 
can trigger the risk. 
2
Market Risk 
Market risks include those that can make the products or operating model of the business irrelevant due 
to the introduction of new technologies, changing consumer behaviour or disruption by competition in 
the form of predatory pricing or disproportionate media spends all of which can threaten the Company’s 
profitability. Unfair competition and brand infringements also pose a risk to the equity of the brand and 
impact business value. The company has in place a process of reviewing possible scenarios for key 
categories during its Monthly Operational Review (MOR). Additionally the Company has a robust brand 
protection and intellectual property management strategy to pro-actively safeguard its winning brands 
and carry out prompt enforcement against infringers.
External/Statutory Auditors
The annual audit of the Company is governed by the 
Companies Act 1994, Securities and Exchange Rules 1987, 
Financial Reporting guidelines issued by BSEC and the 
Financial Reporting Council. As per these regulations, 
auditors are appointed by the Shareholders at each 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) and their remuneration 
is also fixed by the Shareholders at the AGM. Appropriate 
structure is in place as per corporate governance 
best practices to ensure independence of statutory 
auditors. The statutory auditors are rotated every three 
years in compliance with BSEC guidelines. The Audit 
Committee meets the statutory auditors to ensure that 
they are acting independently and reviews the financial 
statements before submission to the Board for approval. 
Non-audit services likely to deter independence are not 
obtained from the statutory auditors. In addition to the 
audit of annual financial statements, the auditors also 
carry out audit of half-yearly financial statements of the 
Company. A. Qasem & Co, Chartered Accountants is the 
statutory auditor and they have no involvement with any 
other services of the Company.
Risk Management
At Marico, we are guided by our robust Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) process that is linked to strategy 
formulation and execution in a systematic manner of 
addressing the top risks facing the Company. The purpose 
of this process is to identify potential events that may 
substantially impact the Company and take commensurate 
initiatives to either protect from or capitalise upon the risk. 
Thus, we use our ERM to drive consistency and resilience 
in our risk methodology. The principal risks faced by the 
Company are mapped out below. 
As a player in the dynamic consumer products market, 
Marico is exposed to a range of external as well as internal 
risks that have the potential to significantly impact its 
performance. Our risk management architecture allows 
us to efficiently manage risks while ensuring competitive 
returns. We identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report 
principal risks that could have a material impact on our 
business. Risk management is a continuous process and 
an integrated part of business management. A summary 
of our principal risks and treatment strategies is provided 
below.

1. Objective
The objective of this Dividend Distribution Policy (“the 
Dividend Distribution Policy”) is to ensure the right 
balance between the quantum of dividend paid and 
profits retained in the business for various purposes. In 
addition, this Policy will also ensure that the distribution 
of dividend is implemented pursuant to the applicable 
legislation in the interests of the shareholders and the 
Company and will also address the management of 
unclaimed dividends.

Association and applicable laws.

and distribute profits in the form of Dividend to the

Proposed Ordinary Resolution for Agenda No. 6
“RESOLVED THAT, approval is hereby granted for the related party transactions between the Company and its associated companies, 
Marico Limited Marico Consumer Care Products S.A.E, Marico Gulf LLC, ZED Lifestyle Pvt Ltd and Marico Middle East FZE as set out in 
the Auditor’s Report & Financial Statements of the Company; 
FURTHER RESOLVED THAT, approval is further granted for related party transactions in the Financial Year 2023-24, for sale or 
purchase of assets in excess of 1% and for the sale or purchase of raw material, packaging material, finished goods or services in excess 
of 10% of the Company’s revenue for Financial Year 2022-23, in the normal course of business and on an arm's length basis.” 
Explanatory Statement for Agenda No. 6
The Company carries out a number of transactions with its parent and associated companies in the normal course of business and 
on an arm's length basis including the purchase of raw material, packaging material, finished goods, machinery or equipment as well 
as recharges for services, sale of finished goods and packaging materials and remittance of royalty and technical assistance fees. 
The purchase from associated companies is done to achieve economies of scale, technical and strategic gains, supply assurance 
and consistent quality. Considering its growth plans, the Company envisages that transactions with related parties being associated 
companies, Marico Limited Marico Consumer Care Products S.A.E, Marico Gulf LLC, ZED Lifestyle Pvt Ltd and Marico Middle East FZE, 
would either individually or in the aggregate, likely exceed the 10% threshold in the case of sale or purchase of raw materials and may 
exceed the 1% threshold for the purchase of assets being machinery and equipment particularly as the Company progresses towards 
the commercial operations of it’s 3rd manufacturing unit at Bangabandhu Shilpanagar. Hence approval is being sought from the 
Shareholders for the aforesaid related party transaction(s) proposed to be entered into by the Company in the financial year 2023-24. 
The Board, as such, recommends the above ordinary resolution for members’ approval.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023
AUDITOR'S REPORT & 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Auditor's Report
To the Shareholders of Marico Bangladesh Limited
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Marico Bangladesh Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the statement 
of financial position as at 31 March 2023, and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement 
of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, of the financial position 
of the Company as at 31 March 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for 
Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Bangladesh, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the 
financial statements, and in forming the auditor's opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures 
designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of 
our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit 
opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
•	
Revenue recognition
	
Referring to the Note 18 and Note 40.15 to the financial statements, Revenue of BOT 14,135 million is recognized 
in the statement of profit or loss of Marico Bangladesh Limited. This material item is subject to considerable inherent 
risk due to the risk of being overstated at the end of the reporting period on account of variation in the timing of 
transfer of control by the management in order to meet expectations of the shareholders and also to achieve 
performance targets. Accordingly, there could be potential misstatements that revenue made during the period end 
are not recognised in the correct reporting period.
How our audit addressed the key audit matter:
In light of the fact that the high degree of complexity and high volume of transactions give rise to an increased risk of 
accounting misstatements, we assessed the Company's processes and controls for recognizing revenue as part of our 
audit. Our audit approach included testing of the controls and substantive audit procedures.
158
•	
Assessed key controls related to the reporting of revenue; starting from the contract approval to the recognition of 
sales and subsequent balance of the customer and cash receipt.
•	
Assessed the invoicing and measurement systems up to entries in the general ledger.
•	
Analysed and tested customer contracts, invoices and receipts on a sample basis.
•	
Tested the sales transactions at the year-end on a sample basis by reviewing the relevant supporting documents to 
ensure the completeness of revenue recognition in the current and subsequent accounting period.
•	
Performed substantive year end cut-off testing by selecting samples of revenue transactions recorded at and after 
year end, and verified the underlying supporting documents.
•	
Scrutinised sales returns and reversals, which were recorded in the general ledger subsequent to year end to identify 
any significant unusual items.
Furthermore, we read and analysed the disclosures made in the financial statements.
•	
Uncertain Tax Position:
Referring to Note 26 & Note 29 of the financial statements, the Company is subject to periodic review by local tax 
authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course of business including indirect taxes and transaction 
related tax matters that could eventually require payments of taxes and possible additional charges. Judgement is 
required in assessing the level of provisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities, required in respect of uncertain tax 
position that reflects management's best estimates of the most likely outcome based on the facts available.
This was a key audit matter because of the amounts involved and because of the estimation of the likely impact and the 
final outcome of these matters.
The Company records provisions for uncertain liabilities, including tax contingencies, when it is more likely than not that 
a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
How our audit addressed the key audit matter:
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence:
•	
Obtained a listing of all ongoing tax litigations
•

ANNUAL REPORT 2023
AUDITOR'S REPORT & 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with 
IFRSs, the Companies Act 1994, the Securities and Exchange Rules 2020 and other applicable laws and regulations and 
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Company's internal control.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
160
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverseconsequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with the Companies Act 1994 and the Securities and Exchange Rules 2020, we also report the following:
i)	
We have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary 
for the purposes of our audit and made do verification thereof;
ii)	
In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the company so far as it appeared 
from our examination of these books;
iii)	 The statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income dealt with by 
the report are in agreement with the books of account and returns; and
iv)	 The expenditure incurred was for the purposes of the company's business.

The title and format of these financial statements follow the requirements of IFRSs which are to some extent different from 
the requirement of the Companies Act, 1994. However, such differences are not material and in the view of management,

These financial statements are authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in its 123rd Board of Directors meeting held

2.4
Comparative and reclassification
Comparative information has been disclosed for all numerical, narrative and descriptive information where it is relevant for 
understanding of the current year financial statements. Comparative figures have been rearranged/reclassified wherever 
considered necessary, to ensure better comparability with the current year financial statements and to comply with relevant 
IFRSs.
3.
Functional and presentation currency
These financial statements are presented in Bangladeshi Taka (Taka/TK/BDT) which is the Company's functional and 
presentation currency. All amounts have been rounded off to the nearest integer.

In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may

the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is described in note 40.04 & 40.17.
(b) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at 31 March 2023 that have a significant risk of resulting in

Salary increase rate

11.4%
Employee turnover rate

Assumptions regarding future mortality have been used based on published statistics and mortality tables. As there is no 
published mortality table in Bangladesh and hence the Indian Assured Lives Mortality rate (2006-08) ultimate based on 
the mortality experience of assured lives in India is being used as a reasonable approximation. This table is based on the 
experience of assured lives in India during the years 2006 to 2008.

37.2
Financial risk management
The Company management has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management 
framework. Risk management policies, procedures and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions 
and the Company's activities. The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
•   Credit risk
•   Liquidity risk
•   Market risk
37.2.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterpart to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation 
which arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers. 
The Company makes sales on advance basis i.e. it receives advance from customers prior to sale, so there is no credit risk due 
to uncollectibility from the customers. However, the Company maintains most of the financial assets with short-term deposits 
and cash and cash equivalents.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the 
reporting date was:

37.2.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets. 
The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet 
its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to 
the Company's reputation.
The contractual maturities of financial liabilities of the Company are as follows:

37.2.2 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that includes changes in market price, such as foreign exchange rate, interest rates, and equity prices 
that may affect the Company's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk 
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis
The basis for the sensitivity analysis to measure foreign exchange risk is an aggregate corporate-level currency exposure. 
The aggregate foreign exchange exposure is composed of all assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
A 1% change in foreign exchange rates would have increased/(decreased) equity and profits or loss by the amounts 
shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates remain constant.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that arises due to changes in interest rates. The Company is not exposed to fluctuations in 
interest rates as it has no floating interest rate bearing financial liability as at the reporting date. The Company has not 
entered into any agreement involving derivative instrument at the reporting date.
As at 31 March 2023, the interest rate profile of the Company's interest bearing financial instruments was:

Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency (BDT) at exchange rates at the dates of 
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at reporting date are re-translated into (BDT) 
at the exchange rates ruling at the statement of financial position date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies, stated at historical cost, are translated into (BDT) at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss.
190
40.02 Property, plant and equipment
i)
Recognition and measurement
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets, bringing 
the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
management.
Parts of an item of property, plant and equipment having different useful lives, are accounted for as separate items 
(major components) of property, plant and equipment.
ii)
Subsequent cost
Subsequent cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised only if it is probable that future economic 
benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Company and its costs can be measured reliably. The costs of the 
day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
iii)
Depreciation
No depreciation is charged on land and asset under construction (AuC) as the land has unlimited useful life and AuC 
has not yet been placed in service /commissioned.
Other items of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis in profit or loss over the estimated 
useful lives of each item of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its 
residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is 
different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately. Depreciation is charged from 
the month of acquisition of property, plant and equipment and no depreciation is charged in the month of disposal.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. 
The estimated useful lives of the items of property, plant and equipment for the current and comparative year are 
as follows:
Assets
Depreciation rate
Plant and machinery
10-33%
Factory equipment
20-33%
Moulds
15-33%
Factory building
5-20%
Laboratory equipment
20-33%
Office equipment
33-50%
Computers
33-50%
Furniture and fixtures
20-50%
Office building
10-20%
A.C and refrigerators
20-33%
iv)
Derecognition
An asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal. 
Gains or losses arising from the derecognition of an asset are determined as the difference between net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets and are recognised in profit or loss.
v)
Asset under construction
Asset under construction represents the cost incurred for acquisition and/or construction of items of property, plant 
and equipment that are not ready for use which is measured at cost. These are transferred to the property, plant and 
equipment on the completion of the projects.
vi)
Capitalisation of borrowing costs
As per the requirements of IAS 23 Borrowing Costs, directly attributable borrowing costs are capitalised during 
construction period for all qualifying assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period 
of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. The borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset are those borrowing costs that would have been avoided if the 
expenditure on the qualifying asset had not been made. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in 
the year in which they are incurred.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023
AUDITOR'S REPORT & 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
40.03
Intangible assets
i)
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets have finite useful lives and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment 
losses. Intangible assets are recognised in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets. Intangible assets include cost 
of acquisition of computer software, intellectual property, copyright and other costs incidental to such capital 
expenditure.
ii)
Subsequent costs
Subsequent costs are capitalised only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific 
asset to which they relate. All other costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
iii)
Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
from the date they are available for use. 
Intangible asset (Computer Software) is amortised at the rate of 20% to 33%.
iv)
Derecognition
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or 
disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of intangible assets, measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets, are recognised in profit or loss.
40.04 Right of use assets
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured 
at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain 
remeasurements of the lease liabilities. When a right-of-use asset meets the definition of investment property, it is presented 
in investment property. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and depreciated using the straight-line method 
from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, 
in accordance with the Company’s accounting policies.
40.05 Investment Property
Investment property is land or a building (including part of a building) or both that is:
• held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both;
• not owner-occupied;
• not used in production or supply of goods and services, or for administration; and
• not held for sale in the ordinary course of business.
Investment property may include investment property that is being redeveloped. 
An investment property is measured initially at cost. For subsequent measurement an entity must adopt either the fair value 
model or the cost model as its accounting policy for all investment properties.
Under the cost model, investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. Fair value is disclosed. Gains and losses on disposal are recognised in profit or 
loss.
40.06 Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on weighted average 
cost method, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs 
incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, 
cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares and 
material in transit are measured at cost.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and selling expenses.
40.07 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturity of three months or less from the date 
of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the company in the 
management of its short term commitments.
192
40.08 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument 
of another entity.
i. Recognition and initial measurement
Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial 
assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is 
initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to 
its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the 
transaction price.
ii. Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial assets – policy applicable from 1 April 2018
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI – debt investment; FVOCI – equity 
investment; or FVTPL.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model 
for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting 
period following the change in the business model.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
-
it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
-
its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
-
it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets; and
-
its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present 
subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. 
This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset 
that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or 
significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Financial assets – business model assessment: policy applicable from 1 April 2018
The Company makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio 
level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information 
considered includes:
- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These 
include whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining 
a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any 
related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Company's management; the 
risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that 
business model) and how those risks are managed;
-
how managers of the business are compensated – e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets 
managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and
-
the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and 
expectations about future sales activity.

Financial assets – subsequent measurement and gains and losses: policy applicable from 1 April 2018
Financial assets at FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, 
including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. 
Financial assets at amortised cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest 
income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit 
or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.
Debt investments at FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated 
using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and 
impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised 
in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to 
profit or loss.
Equity investments at FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as 
income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of 
the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are 
never reclassified to profit or loss.
40.
Significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets includes cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and short term investment.
(a) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and all cash deposits with maturities of three months or less that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Company in the management of its short-
term commitments.
(b) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
(c) Short-term investment
Short-term investment consists of fixed deposits with original maturity of more than three months. The Company 
has the positive intent and ability to hold FDR to maturity, and such financial assets are carried as financial 
assets at amortised cost. Held-to-maturity financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity financial assets are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
iii. Financial liability
All financial liabilities are recognised initially on the transaction date at which the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the liability.
The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or 
expired.
Financial liabilities include trade and other payables etc.
(a) Trade and other payables
The Company recognises trade and intercompany payables when its contractual obligations arising from past 
events are certain and the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources 
embodying economic benefits.
(b) Loans and borrowings
The Company derecognises loans and borrowings when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, 
or expire. The Company also derecognises loans and borrowings when its terms are modified  and the cash 
flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the 
modified terms is recognised at fair value.

40.09 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax 
effects, are recognised as a deduction from equity.
Paid up capital represents total amount contributed by the shareholders and bonus shares, if any, issued by the Company to 
the ordinary shareholders. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are 
entitled to vote at shareholders' meetings. In the event of a winding up of the Company, ordinary shareholders rank after all 
other shareholders and creditors and are fully entitled to any residual proceeds of liquidation.
40.10
Dividend to the equity holders
The Company recognises a liability to make cash dividend when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer 
at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in Bangladesh, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by 
the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.
40.11
Employee benefits
i)
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related 
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus if the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by 
the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
ii)
Defined benefit plan (Gratuity)
The Company operates an unfunded gratuity scheme, provision in respect of which is made annually covering all its 
eligible employees. This scheme is qualified as defined benefit plan.
The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the 
calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised 
past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the 
plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. When the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of the 
increased benefit related to past service by employees is recognised in profit and loss on a straight line basis over 
the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense 
is recognised immediately in profit and loss. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise 
actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Relevant tax impacts of such 
remeasurements are also recognised under other comprehensive income.
iii)
Leave encashment
The Company operates unfunded leave encashment scheme, i.e. if its employees do not avail leave during his/
her service, s/he will be entitled to encash privilege leave at the time of separation from the Company subject to 
maximum 40 days, at the rate of one month's basic pay for 30 days of privilege leave. This scheme is qualified as 
other long term employee benefits.
The Company's net obligation in respect of leave encashment scheme is the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior year and the calculation is performed annually by a 
qualified actuary.
iv)
Workers' profit participation and welfare fund
The Company operates fund for workers as workers' profit participation and welfare fund ("the Fund") and provides 
5% of its profit before tax as per provision of the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006. The Company recognises the 
contribution to the fund as short term employee benefits.
The Fund is governed by Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 as amended up to 28 September 2015 and the trust deed.
40.12
Accruals
Accruals are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have not been paid, invoiced or formally 
agreed with the supplier, including amongst due to employees. Accruals are reported as part of trade and other payables.
40.13
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate thereof can be made. 
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits are required to settle the obligation, the provisions are 
reversed.

Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except 
to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
i)
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Provision for 
corporate income tax is made following the rate applicable for companies as per Finance Act 2022 i.e 22.5%
ii)
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.      
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will 
be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax 
assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised.
40.15
Revenue
The Company has initially applied IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers from 1 April 2018.The Company recognises 
as revenue the amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or 
services when (or as) it transfers control to the customer. To achieve that core principle, IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model 
as follows:
• Identify the contract with a customer;
• Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
• Determine the transaction price;
• Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
• Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Considering the five steps model, the Company recognises revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance 
obligation by transferring a promised good to a customer. Goods are considered as transferred when (or as) the customer 
obtains control of that goods. Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable net of returns and allowances, trade discounts, rebates and Value Added Tax (VAT).
40.16
Finance income and finance cost
i)
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss using 
the effective interest method. 
ii)
Finance cost
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and foreign exchange gain or loss. 
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset 
are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
40.17
Lease liabilities
The lease liabilities is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s 
incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.
The lease liabilities is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liabilities and decreased by lease payment 
made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change 
in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in 
the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is 
reasonably certain not to be exercised.

40.18
Impairment
i. Financial assets
The Company recognises loss allowances for ECLs on:
- financial assets measured at amortised cost;
- debt investments measured at FVOCI; and
- contract assets.
Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
The Company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured 
at 12-month ECLs:
- debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and
- other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the 
financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition.
Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.
When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when 
estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue 
cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company's historical 
experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.
Measurement of ECLs
ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls 
(i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the 
Company expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.
ii) Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets (other than inventories) are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount 
of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset 
belongs. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is 
based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss 
had been recognised.
40.19
Contingencies
i)
Contingent liability
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the 
Company; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because it is not probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or the amount of the 
obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position of the Company. Moreover, contingencies 
arising from claims, litigations, assessments, fines, penalties, etc. are recorded when it is probable that a liability has 
been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
ii)
Contingent asset
Contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.
The Company does not recognise contingent asset.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
40.20 Earnings per share
The Company presents basic earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the 
profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. However, dilution of 
EPS is not applicable for these financial statements as there was no dilutive potential ordinary shares during the relevant years.
40.21
Events after the reporting period
Events after statement of financial position date that provide additional information about the Company's position at the 
statement of financial position date are reflected in the financial statements. Events after statement of financial position date 
that are non-adjusting events are disclosed in the notes when material.
