We have translated our AI principles into a core set of implementation processes, as well as tools, training, and practices to support compliance. But internal programs arenâ€™t enough. We also enable our customers and partners to develop and deploy AI safely, including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio, with its content safety tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard.
